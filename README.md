# Public_Discord_Bot
This bot was created as entertainment.
Its functions:
1. Downloading files, as well as reloading events and commands, which makes it possible not to turn off the bot if something is changed in it at a "non-global" level.
2. Using slash commands.
3. Using prefix commands, by type a!kiss, etc. The prefix can be changed.
